# Orbital mechanics simulation



It simulates the orbital mechanics of celestial bodies using Keplerian elements. It calculates positions and velocities based on orbital parameters.

## Features
- Computes mean anomaly and eccentric anomaly.
- Converts orbital elements into Cartesian coordinates.
- Supports basic orbital simulations for celestial bodies.



## Compilation
To compile the project, run:
```sh
make
```
This will generate an executable in the `build` directory.

## Running the Simulation
After compiling, run:
```sh
./build/orbital_simulation
```

## Dependencies
- C++17 or later
- Standard C++ libraries

## Cleaning Up
To remove compiled files, use:
```sh
make clean
```
